# Introduction_to_Data_Science_in_Python
Study record of the course 'Introduction to Data Science in Python', part of the Applied Data Science using Python Specialization from University of Michigan offered by Coursera

This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including how to download and install python, expected fundamental python programming techniques, and how to find help with python programming questions. The course will also introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the DataFrame as the central data structure for data analysis. The course will end with a statistics primer, showing how various statistical measures can be applied to pandas DataFrames. By the end of the course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it,  manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

Ther is a little project about hypothesis test in Assignment 4:
  
  the Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the     mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom
  (price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom)
